<H1>Description of an analysis page</H1>

The analysis pages are automatically generated at the end of a
simulation and contain some information about the learned units.
In this page we give a detailed explanation of them.


<H2>Optimal stimuli</H2>
<TABLE CELLSPACING="20">

</TR>
</TABLE>

The <B>optimal excitatory stimulus (S+)</B> is the stimulus with norm
'r' that maximally excites the considered unit. 'r' is chosen to be the
mean norm of the input stimuli, because we want S+ to be
representative of the typical input. Since in the simulations
described in the paper the units have a spatio-temporal receptive
field, S+ has a component at time t (left) and one ad time t+dt
(right).  A comparison between the two patches hints at the time behavior
of the unit.  In this example, the unit responds best to a static
oriented edge.

</TR>
</TABLE>

The <B>optimal inhibitory stimulus (S-)</B> is the stimulus with norm 'r'
that maximally inhibits the considered unit. In this example, the unit
responds "worst" to a static edge orthogonal to S+.


<H2>Optimal parameters of S+</H2>
<STRONG>Optimal orientation</STRONG>:   0 deg at time t; 0 deg at time t+dt<BR>
<STRONG>Optimal frequency</STRONG>:  5.625 cycles/deg at time t; 5.625 cycles/deg at time t+dt<BR>
<STRONG>Optimal speed (phase change)</STRONG>:  -5 deg<BR>

<P>
Using a two-dimensional Fourier analysis we extract from S+ several
parameters that are used for example to generate the hexagonal test
image (see below) or to make additional experiments with linear sine
gratings. Here we report the orientation and frequency of the two
components of S+ and the optimal speed, measured by the phase
difference between S+ at time t and at time t+dt. The orientation is
measured counterclockwise between 0 and 180 degrees, 0 being the
horizontal direction. The frequency is reported in cycles/arc deg,
assuming that an input patch is 0.5 arc deg large.

</TABLE>

<P>
To study the response of the unit to a wide range of stimuli we use pairs of
<B>test images</B> (one at time t and one at time t+dt). The
<B>response images</B> are generated by scanning the test images,
cutting at each point a 16x16 window, using it as an input to the unit,
and plotting its output at the corresponding point. The black square
in the upper left corner indicates the size of an input window.

<P>
In the analysis pages we show two different types of response
images. They are generated using the test images shown above (second
row). The left one consists of a circular pattern of sine waves with
frequencies increasing from the circumference to the center. The ring
patterns move outward with the preferred speed of the unit. This test
image gives information not only about the whole range of
<B>frequencies and orientations</B> to which the unit responds or by
which it is inhibited, but also about the
<B>sensitivity to phase</B>. If a unit is sensitive, the
response image will show oscillations in the radial direction, while
if there are no oscillations the unit is phase-invariant. Moreover,
since at two opposite points of a ring the grating is moving in
opposite directions, different responses indicate <B>selectivity to
the direction of motion</B>. The right test image is used to
investigate <B>end- and width-inhibition</B>. The hexagonal shape is
oriented such that it is aligned with the preferred orientation of the
considered unit. The gratings are tuned to the preferred frequency and
move at the preferred speed of the unit.  If a unit is selective for
the length or width of the input, one notices a higher response at the
borders of the hexagon, where only part of the input window is filled,
than in the inner, where the whole input window is filled.

<H2 id="output">Output statistics</H2>

In this section of an analysis page we study the response of the
considered unit to a set of ca. 400,000 previously unseen frames and
report some statistics.

<P>
<STRONG>Beta value</STRONG>: 0.058 <BR>
The beta value is the quantity optimized by SFA, and measures the temporal
variation of the output. It is here defined as
<BR>
beta(y) = 1/(2*Pi) * sqrt(&lt;dy/dt ^2&gt;)  .
<BR>
In particular, a sine wave with period T has an beta value of 1/T.

<P>
<STRONG>Kurtosis</STRONG>: 19.74 <BR> 
Kurtosis is the fourth moment of the distribution of the output
values. It is a measure of the sparseness of the unit, which is
considered to be a desirable property of a neural code according to
some efficiency arguments. We report it here to allow the comparison
with other theoretical models of V1 <a href="#ref1">[1]</a>.

<P>
<STRONG>Sparseness</STRONG>: 67 % <BR>
This is another measure of the sparseness of the unit. It is defined as
<BR>
Sparseness(y) = (1- (&lt;abs(y)&gt;^2/&lt;y^2&gt;)) / (1-(1/n))
<BR>
This measure is normalized such that 100% correspond to a unit responding to
only one particular stimulus, while a unit scoring 0% responds to all
stimuli. We report it here to allow the comparison with experimental
studies <a href="#ref2">[2]</a>.

<TD><IMG SRC="./out_scatter.jpg" WIDTH="400" HEIGHT="300"></TD>
</TR>
</TABLE>

The left graph shows the distribution of the output of the considered
unit. The right graph shows a scatter plot of y(t) vs. y(t+dt) and
gives a qualitative idea of the stability of the output of the units.
Values lying along the diagonal y(t)=y(t+dt) are optimally stable in
time. The superimposed lines are the contours of the joint
distribution of y(t) and y(t+dt). The distances between the contours
follow a logarithmic scale.
