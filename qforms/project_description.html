 <p>Recent research in neuroscience has seen an increasing number of extensions
of established linear techniques to their nonlinear equivalent, in both
experimental and theoretical studies.  This is the case, for example, for
spatio-temporal receptive-field estimates in physiological studies and
information theoretical models like principal component analysis (PCA) and
independent component analysis (ICA).  Additionally, new nonlinear
algorithms have been introduced, like slow feature analysis (SFA).  The
study of the resulting nonlinear functions can be a difficult task because
of the lack of appropriate tools to characterize them qualitatively and
quantitatively.</p>
 <p>In this work we introduce some mathematical and numerical methods to
analyze and interpret generic inhomogeneous quadratic forms.  The resulting
characterization is in some aspects similar to that given by physiological
studies of the receptive fields of cortical cells, making it particularly
suitable for application to second-order approximations and theoretical
models of physiological receptive fields.  We illustrate the proposed
algorithms using the quadratic forms computed in a theoretical model of
self-organization of complex-cell receptive field (Berkes and Wiskott,
2002).</p>
 <p>We first discuss two standard ways of analyzing a quadratic form by
directly visualizing the coefficients of its quadratic and linear terms and
by considering the eigenvectors of its quadratic term.  This method often
allows to gain some intuition of the behavior of the quadratic form, but a
direct interpretation is sometimes difficult and the interaction between
linear and quadratic term is not considered.</p>
 <p>We then present an algorithm to compute the optimal excitatory and
inhibitory stimuli, i.e. the stimuli that maximize and minimize the
considered quadratic form, respectively, given a fixed energy constraint.
This is similar to the physiological practice of characterizing a neuron by
the stimulus to which it responds best.  The solution to this problem is
unique and its mathematical formulation can be reduced to an efficient
linear search over one parameter on a bounded range.</p>
 <p>Since we are considering non-linear functions, the optimal stimuli do not
provide a complete description of their properties.  We therefore next
consider the invariances of the optimal stimuli, which are the
transformations to which the quadratic form is most insensitive.  This is
similar to the common interpretation of neurons as detectors of a specific
feature of the input with an invariance to certain local transformations of
that feature.  For example, complex cells in the primary visual cortex are
thought to respond to oriented bars and to be invariant to a local
translation.  To do this, we compute the second derivative of the quadratic
form at the optimal stimulus but restricted to the sphere of input patterns
of constant energy.  This can be done by considering special paths on the
sphere known as geodetics and computing the second derivative of the
function along them.  We derive in this way an explicit formula for the
quadratic form that describes the second derivative.  The invariances are found to be
the eigenvectors corresponding to the eigenvalues of largest magnitude.
The invariances can then be visualized by moving on the sphere in the
direction of the eigenvectors and stopping as soon as the output of the
function drops under a given threshold.  For each quadratic form with N
variables we can find in this way N-1 invariances.  We propose a test to
determine which of these invariances are statistically significant.  This
can be done by comparing the second derivatives in the direction of the
invariances with those of random quadratic forms that are equally adapted
to the statistics of the input data.</p>
 <p>We further derive simpler versions of the above results in the special case
of a quadratic form without linear term and discuss the analysis of such
homogeneous quadratic forms in some theoretical and experimental studies.</p>
 <p>Finally, we show that for each quadratic form one can build an equivalent
two-layer neural network, formed by a first layer of linear subunits
followed by a quadratic nonlinearity and a multiplication with weighting
coefficients.  The output neuron also receives a direct linear contribution
from the input layer.  Since the weighting coefficients can be negative,
some of the subunits give an inhibitory contribution to the output.  Such a
network is compatible with (but more general than) related networks used in
some recent papers and the energy model of complex cells.  We show that the
subunits are unique only up to two arbitrary orthogonal transformations of
the positive and negative subunits, respectively.</p>
